Trying to figure out what API to use led me to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/gofryv/opengl_vs_directx/) discussion and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameenginedevs/comments/smaitc/what_is_the_best_way_to_learn_directx/) one.
Therefore I'll first start with trying to learn DirectX11. In [DirectX 11 rastertek guide](https://rastertek.com/) (from the second discussion) they skip in my opinion too quickly over how to set up a 
window, so I'll try to figure that out. Currently I am looking at the [win32 api guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/LearnWin32/learn-to-program-for-windows) on Microsofts website.
