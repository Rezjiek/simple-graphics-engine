# simple-graphics-engine
This project is a combination of trying to learn how to use Github, Visual Studio and C++ properly. 
I have done some small projects in Python and C++ before, although poorly documented and implemented.
This is my attempt at trying to create a program in which one can display fractals and other mathematically described shapes.
